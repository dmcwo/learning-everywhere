WI+RE &#40;Writing Instruction + Research Education&#41; is a collaborative design team that partners undergraduate and graduate student employees with staff from UCLA Library, Writing Programs, the Undergraduate Research Centers, the Center for Digital Humanities, and the Office of Instructional Development.

<p>"<em>WI+RE's been an unexpected creative outlet, allowing me to challenge and reconsider how I approach my own work. The tutorials we have designed as a team have benefited me not only in their final form, but in the process of designing and redesigning them.</em>" - Taylor Harper</p>

<p>"<em>Being a part of the WI+RE team has not only taught me a wealth of new technical and creative skills, but has also totally changed my career path for after graduate school. After learning about the radically creative work happening behind the scenes at academic libraries, I'm now hoping to continue work similar to WI+RE after I graduate this spring.</em>" - Caitlin Meyer</p>
